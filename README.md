# Predicting Car Accidents

## About This Project
This is a **group project** for the **Data Mining** course. The goal is to **predict the likelihood of car accidents** using real-world data. The project includes data analysis, preprocessing, and applying data mining techniques to understand patterns and make predictions.

## What We Did
1. **Data Selection:**  
   - Chose a dataset on car accidents with multiple attributes.  
   - Documented the dataset source, attributes, and class labels.

2. **Data Summarization & Preprocessing:**  
   - Visualized distributions and relationships using scatter plots, histograms, and bar charts.  
   - Cleaned data, handled missing values, encoded categorical features, normalized values, and selected important features.

3. **Data Mining:**  
   - **Classification:** Applied Decision Tree with different partition sizes and selection criteria (Gini & Entropy).  
   - **Clustering:** Applied K-means with various K values, evaluated results with Silhouette and Elbow methods.  
   - Visualized and interpreted results to understand patterns and model performance.
